## Pacman Game
Hi everyone!! This is just a fun Pacman game made from java. Pacman has always been a legendary game in my childhood and that sparks up the reason for me to make this game.
The rules will be exactly the same as one in a Pacman game. You're job is to pick up the white dots, which are your food, and avoid the ghost. You will have 3 lives and if you touch the ghosts, you lose 1 live. 
The four up down left right arrows will control the pacman. If you want to pause the game, press P to pause and press any other button to continue the game.
That's it for the overview of my game. I hope that y'all will like it!!
